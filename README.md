 Recursive Inscription templates

Recursive inscription templates using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which can be edited to display your own inscriptions on X or ord.io.

1. Replace the inscription IDs with your own inscription IDs in each corresponding template

  Inscription IDs will look like the following: 542efe9ae3dbab7634a68a35a332360ee7db42ab906d2e385bc9c928fd2b0e8bi0

  You can use less or more IDs in the template depending on how many inscriptions you want to display

  If you want to see a preview of the inscription before inscribing, you can add https://ordinals.com before /content/ then save an open in browser.

Remember to remove https://ordinals.com again before inscribing

3. Save

4. Inscribe

   Note: The ord.io inscription won't show up correctly on explorers as it automatically fits to the height of the screen. But when used as a banner on ord.io it will automatically adjust to fit the screen size your viewing it on.
