 Recursive Inscription templates

Recursive inscription templates using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which can be edited to display your own inscriptions on X or ord.io.

First download the template and open in a code editor

If you’re getting the code from an inscription click the </> button in the bottom right hand corner on ord.io to reveal the code

Copy and paste into text editor or any other code editor 

These templates use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render all the separate inscriptions on a canvas, so the final inscription acts like an image 

You can play around with the code however you like but the only thing you actually need to change are the inscription ID's 


1. Replace the inscription IDs with your own inscription IDs in each corresponding template.

  Inscription IDs will look like the following: 542efe9ae3dbab7634a68a35a332360ee7db42ab906d2e385bc9c928fd2b0e8bi0

  You can find them on all the market places and explorers.

  You can use less or more IDs in the template depending on how many inscriptions you want to display.

  If you want to see a preview of the inscription before inscribing, you can add https://ordinals.com before /content/ then save and open the HTML in your browser

Remember to remove https://ordinals.com again before inscribing.

2. Save as .html file

3. Inscribe .html file

This can be done on any inscription service, but even better if you do it on your own node.

We made a few different templates to use depending on how you want the final outcome.


The resulting inscription is fully on chain and can be right click saved as an image to use wherever you want. 

You’ll see with most of these cases the saved image is heaps bigger than 400 kB, which is usually the max for an inscription.

Without recursion images of this size and quality wouldn’t be possible 

There’s basically no limit to how many you want to include, this is just the basics, we started simple so anyone can have a play with it but there’s no reason you couldn’t have all 2100 OMB in the same image 

   Note: The ord.io inscription won't show up correctly on explorers as it automatically fits to the height of the screen. But when used as a banner on ord.io it will automatically adjust to fit the screen size your viewing it on.
